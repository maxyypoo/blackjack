tackling variables
    simple way
        have 2 variables, 1 for holding past total, 1 for newly generated number do for both dealer and player
    complicated way
        have string formated such that first two letters are numbers indicating numeric value, third letter is typing(D,H,S,C), final letter is what deck it belongs to(if played with multiple decsk)
        acces with char at and use conditionals or type sets(even '1' type set to int is smaller than '2' ) to get totals
    shuffleDeck()
        create 52 entities, assign each with a card number and type, and deal
do simple loop to start the program with while, conditional variable set to yes initially to loop
randomize and deal 2 cards to both hands
show player 1 card off of dealer, and ask if they want to draw, enter into another loop
game ends with a player losing and program asking if player would like another round

#with either way, no need for complicated actions like shuffleDeck() as simple way is too simple and complicated way we can simply re run loop until viable card
#either way we dont need to make 52 elements and assign them value, since both that and these ways are equally random for any player

#to spice up we can add starting bet to see if player can bankrupt dealer or vice versa
#using complicated method one can also code multiple card games, simple would only work to generate a hand for blackjack
#shuffleDeck such codes would work better for poker since black jack decks are shuffled after each win, defeating the act of creating 52 cards
